I want to find out what factors affect movie ratings by obtaining data on the most popular movies in the last three years,
including the ratings of the top20 movies in the last three years, 
the star information, the country of origin, 
the gender of the rater, the age and other data sets, 
so as to recommend a movie for someone.
