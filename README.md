# 🎬 Movie Rating Analysis & Prediction

## 📌 Overview

This project explores how key attributes of movies — such as **budget**, **genre**, **duration**, and **number of ratings** — influence **IMDb scores**. The goal is to identify what makes a movie highly rated and to **predict movie ratings** using machine learning techniques.

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- Scrape and clean real-world movie data from IMDb and other sources.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to find insights about high-rated movies.
- Train a **Random Forest** model to predict IMDb ratings based on features like genre, budget, and duration.
- Draw statistical insights on genre popularity and performance trends.

---

## 🗃️ Dataset Summary

All cleaned data are stored in the `/data` folder:
- `movie_api_top_250.json`
- `movie_budget.json`
- `movie_info.json`
- `movie_imb_data.csv`
- `movie_url.json`

Data was scraped from the web and transformed into structured formats for analysis.

## 🧪 Key Findings

- 🎥 Action movies dominate the top-rated and most-followed categories.
- 🎨 Animation movies are shorter and tend to receive higher scores.
- 💰 Budget and runtime are strong predictors of a film’s rating.
- 🌲 Random Forest model achieved **95%+ accuracy** in predicting rating tiers.

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the scraping and transformation pipeline
```bash
cd src
python main.py       # Scrapes data and stores JSON
python extract.py    # Converts JSON into CSV for analysis
```

### 3. Open the analysis notebook
Open `report.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to explore the full analysis and modeling steps.

## 🚧 Known Limitations

- Web scraping may take more than 10 minutes.
- Data may have missing fields depending on source availability.
- Model performance might not generalize well beyond IMDb top movies.
